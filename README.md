# Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Continuum Robots: Towards Fast Approximation of Static Cosserat Rod Theory

Code to the ICRA 2024 publication: DOI 10.1109/ICRA57147.2024.10610742

This code uses the Cosserat rod statics C++ implementation from 
https://github.com/SvenLilge/tdcr-modeling
through a pybind11 binding.
